# CHADS-BLED Benefit Calc ⚖️

A clinical decision support tool designed to synchronize stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc) 
and major bleeding risk (HAS-BLED) for patients with Atrial Fibrillation.

## 🩺 Clinical Basis
This tool digitizes and integrates established validation studies:
- **CHA₂DS₂-VASc:** Based on Lip GY, et al. (2010), validated via the Swedish AF Cohort.
- **HAS-BLED:** Based on Pisters R, et al. (2010), validated for 1-year major bleed risk.

## 🚀 Usage
This app provides a **Net Clinical Benefit** calculation, subtracting the annual 
bleeding risk from the annual stroke risk to assist in the shared-decision 
making process for anticoagulation.
